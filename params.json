If necessary these suggestions can be set aside for creative purposes; for instance, attempting to imitate a particular style. Please, however, ensure your section editor has a sense of humour — make it obvious it is for comedic purposes, and not human error.\r\n\r\n* The most important thing is consistency. Pick a rule and stick to it.\r\n* Use the Oxford comma. It removes ambiguity.\r\n    - DO: At the dinner party I will serve: quinoa, organic barley wine, and dessicated salmon.\r\n    - DO: My parents, Koen Lamberts, and Malcolm Grant came to my graduation.\r\n    - DON’T: At the dinner party I will serve: quinoa, organic barley wine and dessicated salmon. \r\n    - DON’T: My parents, Koen Lamberts and Malcolm Grant came to my graduation. \r\n        - This would suggest Koen and Malcolm are your parents.\r\n* Only use titles when relevant to the article, e.g. Dr Whomever.\r\n* Single quotation marks to be used for all reported speech and as ‘scare quotes’ to highlight a particular phrase.\r\n    - Embedded quotations don’t need to have commas before the quotation opens.\r\n        - DO: The students described it as ‘questionable’.\r\n        - DON’T: The students described it as, ‘questionable’.\r\n    - Punctuation is always placed outside of the quotation mark unless the full sentence is quoted.\r\n        + DO: The group issued a statement saying, ‘We find this situation absolutely abhorrent.’\r\n        + DO: The group described the situation as ‘abhorrent’.\r\n        + DON’T: The group issued a statement saying, ‘We find this situation absolutely abhorrent’.\r\n        + DON’T: The group described it as ‘abhorrent.’\r\n* Headlines.\r\n    * Capitalise the first letter of the headline, and then any other significant words. Do not capitalise articles and conjunctions. \r\n        + DO: Group of Grumpy Students Align with Nazi Party\r\n        + DON’T: Group Of Grumpy Students Align With Nazi Party\r\n        + DON’T: Group of grumpy students align with nazi party\r\n    * Don’t put full stops at the end of headlines. You may, however, use question marks or exclamation marks as appropriate.\r\n* Taglines, where used, should be formatted like a regular sentence but should not end with a full stop.\r\n* Please refrain from using interrobangs: ‘‽’.\r\n* Acronyms, initialisms, and abbreviations.\r\n    - Common acronyms (for our audience) do not need to be explained first, e.g. YUSU, UoY, NUS.\r\n    - Acronyms that are less well known should have their full form written first then the acronym in brackets for further references in the article.\r\n        + DO: The Trades Union Congress (TUC) today decided to [...]\r\n        + DO: YUSU have disbanded.\r\n    - DON’T: The TUC today decided to [...]\r\n    - DON’T: York University Students’ Union have disbanded.\r\n* Don’t capitalise professions; do capitalise positions.\r\n    - DO:  The Chancellor of the Galactic Republic today declared a state of emergency.\r\n    - DON’T: The chancellor of the galactic republic today declared a state of emergency.",
