Version: 0.5 (Consultation Version)
Date: 23/04/16
Authors: Taghreed Ayaz, Henry Dyer
</code></pre>

<p>The following is a guide, and not a set of rules. If necessary these suggestions can be set aside for creative purposes; for instance, attempting to imitate a particular style. Please, however, ensure your section editor has a sense of humour — make it obvious it is for comedic purposes, and not human error.</p>

<ul>
<li>The most important thing is consistency. Pick a rule and stick to it.</li>
<li>Use the Oxford comma. It removes ambiguity.

<ul>
<li>DO: At the dinner party I will serve: quinoa, organic barley wine, and dessicated salmon.</li>
<li>DO: My parents, Koen Lamberts, and Malcolm Grant came to my graduation.</li>
<li>DON’T: At the dinner party I will serve: quinoa, organic barley wine and dessicated salmon. </li>
<li>DON’T: My parents, Koen Lamberts and Malcolm Grant came to my graduation. 

<ul>
<li>This would suggest Koen and Malcolm are your parents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Only use titles when relevant to the article, e.g. Dr Whomever.</li>
<li>Single quotation marks to be used for all reported speech and as ‘scare quotes’ to highlight a particular phrase.

<ul>
<li>Embedded quotations don’t need to have commas before the quotation opens.

<ul>
<li>DO: The students described it as ‘questionable’.</li>
<li>DON’T: The students described it as, ‘questionable’.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Punctuation is always placed outside of the quotation mark unless the full sentence is quoted.

<ul>
<li>DO: The group issued a statement saying, ‘We find this situation absolutely abhorrent.’</li>
<li>DO: The group described the situation as ‘abhorrent’.</li>
<li>DON’T: The group issued a statement saying, ‘We find this situation absolutely abhorrent’.</li>
<li>DON’T: The group described it as ‘abhorrent.’</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Headlines.

<ul>
<li>Capitalise the first letter of the headline, and then any other significant words. Do not capitalise articles and conjunctions. 

<ul>
<li>DO: Group of Grumpy Students Align with Nazi Party</li>
<li>DON’T: Group Of Grumpy Students Align With Nazi Party</li>
<li>DON’T: Group of grumpy students align with nazi party</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t put full stops at the end of headlines. You may, however, use question marks or exclamation marks as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taglines, where used, should be formatted like a regular sentence but should not end with a full stop.</li>
<li>Please refrain from using interrobangs: ‘‽’.</li>
<li>Acronyms, initialisms, and abbreviations.

<ul>
<li>Common acronyms (for our audience) do not need to be explained first, e.g. YUSU, UoY, NUS.</li>
<li>Acronyms that are less well known should have their full form written first then the acronym in brackets for further references in the article.

<ul>
<li>DO: The Trades Union Congress (TUC) today decided to [...]</li>
<li>DO: YUSU have disbanded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DON’T: The TUC today decided to [...]</li>
<li>DON’T: York University Students’ Union have disbanded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t capitalise professions; do capitalise positions.

<ul>
<li>DO:  The Chancellor of the Galactic Republic today declared a state of emergency.</li>
<li>DON’T: The chancellor of the galactic republic today declared a state of emergency.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
