      <pre><code>The Lemon Press Style Guide
Version: 1.2
Date: 13/02/17
Authors: Taghreed Ayaz, Henry Dyer
</code></pre>

<p>The following is a guide, and not a set of rules. If necessary these suggestions can be set aside for creative purposes; for instance, attempting to imitate a particular style. Please, however, ensure your section editor has a sense of humour — make it obvious it is for comedic purposes, and not human error.</p>

<pre>
<code>
Justified for shorter articles.
Ragged for longer articles.
Headline for headlines.
</code>
</pre>

<ul>
<li>The most important thing is consistency. Pick a rule and stick to it.</li>
<li>Use the Oxford comma. It removes ambiguity. Do not, however, insert it into names for things if not there in the first place.

<ul>
<li>DO: At the dinner party I will serve: quinoa, organic barley wine, and dessicated salmon.</li>
<li>DO: My parents, Koen Lamberts, and Malcolm Grant came to my graduation.</li>
<li>DO: The Department of Culture, Media and Sport</li>
<li>DON’T: At the dinner party I will serve: quinoa, organic barley wine and dessicated salmon. </li>
<li>DON’T: My parents, Koen Lamberts and Malcolm Grant came to my graduation. </li>

<ul>
<li>This would suggest Koen and Malcolm are your parents.</li>
</ul>
<li>DON'T: The Department of Culture, Media, and Sport</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Only use titles when relevant to the article, e.g. Dr Whomever.</li>
<li>Single quotation marks to be used for all reported speech and as ‘scare quotes’ to highlight a particular phrase.

<ul>
<li>Embedded quotations don’t need to have commas before the quotation opens.

<ul>
<li>DO: The students described it as ‘questionable’.</li>
<li>DON’T: The students described it as, ‘questionable’.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Punctuation is always placed outside of the quotation mark unless the full sentence is quoted.

<ul>
<li>DO: The group issued a statement saying, ‘We find this situation absolutely abhorrent.’</li>
<li>DO: The group described the situation as ‘abhorrent’.</li>
<li>DON’T: The group issued a statement saying, ‘We find this situation absolutely abhorrent’.</li>
<li>DON’T: The group described it as ‘abhorrent.’</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Headlines.

<ul>
<li>Capitalise the first letter of the headline, and then any other significant words. Do not capitalise articles and conjunctions. 

<ul>
<li>DO: Group of Grumpy Students Align with Nazi Party</li>
<li>DON’T: Group Of Grumpy Students Align With Nazi Party</li>
<li>DON’T: Group of grumpy students align with nazi party</li>
<li>DON'T: GROUP OF GRUMPY STUDENTS ALIGN WITH NAZI PARTY</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t put full stops at the end of headlines. You may, however, use question marks or exclamation marks as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taglines, where used, should be formatted like a regular sentence but should not end with a full stop.</li>
<li>Please refrain from using interrobangs: ‘‽’.</li>
<li>Acronyms, initialisms, and abbreviations.

<ul>
<li>Common acronyms (for our audience) do not need to be explained first, e.g. YUSU, UoY, NUS.</li>
<li>Acronyms that are less well known should have their full form written first then the acronym in brackets for further references in the article.

<ul>
<li>DO: The Trades Union Congress (TUC) today decided to [...]</li>
<li>DO: YUSU have disbanded.</li>
<li>DON’T: The TUC today decided to [...]</li>
<li>DON’T: York University Students’ Union have disbanded.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t capitalise professions; do capitalise positions, but only when being used as a title, or as replacement for the name. Otherwise, lowercase.

<ul>
<li>DO:  The President today declared a state of emergency.</li>
  <li>DO:  The President of the United States is a title.</li>
  <li>DO:  Go President Jeb Bush! Jeb Bush for president!</li>
  <li>DO:  The 45th and current president — he's not my president. I wanted Jeb Bush to be president.</li>
<li>DON’T: The president declared a state of emergency.</li>
  <li>DON'T: The president of the United States is a title.</li>
  <li>DON'T: Go president Jeb Bush! Jeb Bush for President!</li>
  <li>DON'T: The 45th and current President - he's not my President. I wanted Jeb Bush to be President.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
  Editor's notes are to be formatted as: [<i>content in italics surrounded by square brackets</i> - Ed.]
</li>
 <li>
   Italicise the names of publications, e.g. <i>The Lemon Press</i>, <i>Nouse</i>, and <i>York Vision.</i> If the surrounding text is already italicised, such as in a image caption, then do the reverse.
  </li>
</ul>
