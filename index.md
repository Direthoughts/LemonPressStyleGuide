The following is a guide, and not a set of rules. If necessary these suggestions can be set aside for creative purposes; for instance, attempting to imitate a particular style. Please, however, ensure your section editor has a sense of humour — make it obvious it is for comedic purposes, and not human error.

* The most important thing is consistency. Pick a rule and stick to it.
* Use the Oxford comma. It removes ambiguity.
    - DO: At the dinner party I will serve: quinoa, organic barley wine, and dessicated salmon.
    - DO: My parents, Koen Lamberts, and Malcolm Grant came to my graduation.
    - DON’T: At the dinner party I will serve: quinoa, organic barley wine and dessicated salmon. 
    - DON’T: My parents, Koen Lamberts and Malcolm Grant came to my graduation. 
        - This would suggest Koen and Malcolm are your parents.
* Only use titles when relevant to the article, e.g. Dr Whomever.
* Single quotation marks to be used for all reported speech and as ‘scare quotes’ to highlight a particular phrase.
    - Embedded quotations don’t need to have commas before the quotation opens.
        - DO: The students described it as ‘questionable’.
        - DON’T: The students described it as, ‘questionable’.
    - Punctuation is always placed outside of the quotation mark unless the full sentence is quoted.
        + DO: The group issued a statement saying, ‘We find this situation absolutely abhorrent.’
        + DO: The group described the situation as ‘abhorrent’.
        + DON’T: The group issued a statement saying, ‘We find this situation absolutely abhorrent’.
        + DON’T: The group described it as ‘abhorrent.’
* Headlines.
    * Capitalise the first letter of the headline, and then any other significant words. Do not capitalise articles and conjunctions. 
        + DO: Group of Grumpy Students Align with Nazi Party
        + DON’T: Group Of Grumpy Students Align With Nazi Party
        + DON’T: Group of grumpy students align with nazi party
    * Don’t put full stops at the end of headlines. You may, however, use question marks or exclamation marks as appropriate.
* Taglines, where used, should be formatted like a regular sentence but should not end with a full stop.
* Please refrain from using interrobangs: ‘‽’.
* Acronyms, initialisms, and abbreviations.
    - Common acronyms (for our audience) do not need to be explained first, e.g. YUSU, UoY, NUS.
    - Acronyms that are less well known should have their full form written first then the acronym in brackets for further references in the article.
        + DO: The Trades Union Congress (TUC) today decided to [...]
        + DO: YUSU have disbanded.
    - DON’T: The TUC today decided to [...]
    - DON’T: York University Students’ Union have disbanded.
* Don’t capitalise professions; do capitalise positions.
    - DO:  The Chancellor of the Galactic Republic today declared a state of emergency.
    - DON’T: The chancellor of the galactic republic today declared a state of emergency.
